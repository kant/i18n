A `BrowserView` can be used to embed additional web content into a [`BrowserWindow`](browser-window.md). It is like a child window, except that it is positioned relative to its owning window. It is meant to be an alternative to the `webview` tag.

## Example

```javascript
// ใน main process
const { BrowserView, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

let win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 })
win.on('closed', () => {
  win = null
})

let view = new BrowserView()
win.setBrowserView(view)
view.setBounds({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300 })
view.webContents.loadURL('https://electronjs.org')
```
